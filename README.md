# Hi, I'm Muna.
I'm a Front End Engineer who has a passion for building creative
projects and solving problems. I am a lifelong learner
always looking to stretch my comfort zone.
I enjoy working with JavaScript and React and I am excited
to be exposed to more parts of the ever expanding world
of tech.
